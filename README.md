# Getting Started with Netify Serverless Function

This is the most simple function servering a json file, as this static it does can be done without using functions easily.

## Make sure to run `Netlify login`
I spent quite a bit of time trying to get it to work locally.  I didn't realise even for local development it requires for you to login.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
